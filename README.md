# servicedog
A simple application that helps monitoring Windows based applications, specially .net apps.

<h2>The need</h2>
In an environment full of application tiers, where distributed applications talk to each oder almost in a streamlined way, it is indispensable having a tool that helps to monitor all these integrations.
For that matter we can count on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management" _target="blank">Application Performance Management -APM-</a>. We have very good APM choices out there in Internet but, unfortunately, for .net running in Windows one must to pay (a lot) for licences. That is why I decided to build servicedog. It will be free and opensource. Forever.
